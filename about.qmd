## Biography

I am Patrick Schäfer (Dr. rer. nat., Dipl. Inform.), a senior researcher at
Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin. My work centers on machine learning for time series data,
scalable similarity search, and vector databases. I design algorithms with rigorous
guarantees and turn them into reliable software artifacts such as the open-source
[**aeon** toolkit](https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/).

I obtained my doctorate at HU Berlin on scalable time series classification and have
been part of research projects at Zuse Institute Berlin and in various industry
collaborations focused on large-scale analytics.
